//! The master limiter on the mixer's main track (card MIXH): a lookahead
//! peak limiter, stereo-linked, its ceiling at full scale. The PS2 has
//! none - its SPU2 clamps each core's sum (analysis/re-mix-headroom.md 1.1
//! claim 2) - and with the PS2's per-ear law the port's busiest fights
//! still clamp in up to 0.07 % of frames where the PS2's own read 0.02 %
//! (the port's battle stacks more starts beside the player). A modern
//! deviation, named in FEEL_NOTES: a mix that never reaches full scale (a
//! lone shot, any quiet stretch) passes untouched, only delayed by the
//! lookahead; a stack over full scale is turned down from `LOOKAHEAD`
//! before its peak and comes back over `RELEASE` instead of clipping.
